# Specifications about the app

This is a simple pomodoro app. It will be easy to use easy to track the number of hours.

## Features

- It will create a timer that finishes and starts automatically untill the number of sets are finished.
- Timer and rest duration will be customizable.
- Users can tag the timer so it can be used to show the detail progress using charts and pie charts.
- For backend I will use firebase.
- I want to include the spotify api to it but I am not sure??

## Problem and solution section

- When I was hovering over the position:fixed elements it didn't let me scroll, Solution was to add a new css property to position fixed elements,
  which is pointerEvents: "none"
